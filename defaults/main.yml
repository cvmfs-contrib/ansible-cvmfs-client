### Settings for Ansible role

# Which configuration domains to set up. Possible values include the following:
# cvmfs-config-default - sets up EGI, OSG and CERN repositories
# cvmfs-config-computecanada - sets up Compute Canada repositories
cvmfs_configuration:
  - "cvmfs-config-default"
#  - "cvmfs-config-computecanada"

# If cvmfs_gid and cvmfs_uid are both defined, then Ansible will ensure that a 'cvmfs' 
# account with those ids is present before CVMFS is installed. You should make sure to do
# this when deploying CVMFS on a cluster, in case an alien cache might be used.
# cvmfs_gid: "8000131"
# cvmfs_uid: "13000004"

# Whether to set up and use autofs to mount CVMFS repositories (recommended for standard deployment scenarios).
# If false, static mounts will be configured instead (may be necessary for some container engines to use CVMFS).
# Switching a client system from autofs to static mode requires some manual operations and is not supported by this Ansible role.
cvmfs_auto_setup: true

# Set to true (only as a one-time option with -e) to switch from static mode to autofs. Will unmount all repos!
cvmfs_force_unmount: false

# See `man autofs.conf`
#cvmfs_autofs_timeout: 300

# Whether to configure a PV/VG/LV and filesystem for the CVMFS cache,
# according to cvmfs_client_pv_name, cvmfs_client_vg_name, and
# cvmfs_client_lv_name as described below. If false, you will need to
# configure the cache storage yourself instead, and also ensure it is the required size.
cvmfs_client_configure_storage: false

# If this block device name is defined, then a volume group, logical volume, and filesystem will be created on it.
# If it is not defined, then a volume group is assumed to already exist and will be used instead.
# In either case, the name of the volume group is given by cvmfs_client_vg_name.
#cvmfs_client_pv_name: "vdb"

# Name of the volume group for the CVMFS local cache filesystem.
cvmfs_client_vg_name: "cvmfsvg"

# Name of the logical volume for the CVMFS local cache filesystem.
cvmfs_client_lv_name: "cvmfs"

### Settings for CVMFS client
# For further details on CVMFS client configuration settings refer to:
#   https://cvmfs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/apx-parameters.html
#   https://cvmfs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cpt-configure.html

# Size of the local cache filesystem in megabytes. The cache usage quota (CVMFS_QUOTA_LIMIT) will be automatically
# set to ~ 85% of this amount, to allow for momentary usage beyond the quota while cache clean-up is in progress.
cvmfs_cache_size: "50000"

# The list of repositories that will be accessible. CVMFS_STRICT_MOUNT is enabled so this IS 
# an exclusive list; your inventory must include any additional repositories you wish to use.
# In particular cvmfs-config.computecanada.ca is required for other Compute Canada repositories to function.
cvmfs_repositories:
  - "soft.computecanada.ca"
  - "cvmfs-config.computecanada.ca"

# The list of caching proxy servers to use.
# For more info see
#   https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Accessing_CVMFS
#   https://cvmfs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cpt-configure.html#proxy-lists
cvmfs_http_proxy: "DIRECT"

# This dict allows arbitrary CVMFS client settings to be applied in /etc/cvmfs/default.local .
# Use this to apply any other settings, aside from those already defined by 
# other variables (CVMFS_REPOSITORIES, CVMFS_QUOTA_LIMIT, CVMFS_HTTP_PROXY).
# For example:
# cvmfs_client_conf:
#   CVMFS_INSTRUMENT_FUSE: "true"
cvmfs_client_conf: {}
