# Target hosts will need internet access anyway to install the actual packages via yum, so we might as well
# install the yum config from the internet as well - if a version is not already installed. 
# There is no benefit to abstracting this with the yum_repository module, and doing so would break idempotence
# because these packages update themselves via their own yum repositories.
